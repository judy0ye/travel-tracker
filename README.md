### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
This application simulates a travel tracker, where users can book a trip by filling out a form. After reviewing the estimates of the trip, they can submit it to the agency for review. This application also allows users to look through their past trips and see their total expense per year. This project runs on a local server and interacts with API endpoints.


### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
In order to use this project, please follow the steps below:
- Fork this repository
- In the same folder, clone down both the forked repository and this [repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
- CD into the both repositories on separate terminals and run ```npm install``` to download all the library dependencies
- Open the project in your chosen text editor
- View and interact with the project live by running ```npm start``` on both terminals and copy the localhost address http://localhost:8080/ to your web browser
  - the username is 'traveler' followed by any number between 1-50 (ex. traveler15) and the password is 'travel'

## üè´ Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I worked on it for approximately 45 hours and I am 12 weeks into Turing School of Software and Design's coding bootcamp.

## üìö Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goals include using array prototype methods to perform data manipulation, creating a clear and accesible user interface, making network requests, implemenint a robust testing suite using TDD and writing single responsibility principle code that's reusable.

## üå± Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
- Buidling an application with accessibility in mind and impleteing network requests to send and retrieve data in a short amount of time is a win!

Challenges:
- Planning out how to execute and where to start was difficult, but once I was able to make a small part work, I began to build on top of that.
